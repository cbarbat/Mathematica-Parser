#Mathematica (Wolfram Language) Parser

This is an open source *Pratt parser* written in *Java* that can parse *Mathematica* and/or
the *Wolfram Language* syntax.

##![Documentation][doc-image] Documentation

This work is heavily based on an effort by Patrick Scheibe, who wrote an *IntelliJ IDEA Plugin*
for the *Mathematica* language. I was very impressed by Patrick's parser and decided not only
to fork it but to also make a stand-alone parser which doesn't depend on *IDEA* code anymore.

My parser differs however from Patrick's parser. I hope to have improved some parselets, e.g.:

- **DerivativeParselet**

- **ListParselet**

- **SymbolParselet**

- **TagSetParselet**

I also deleted the three infix blank/blank sequence/blank null sequence expression parselets
as they are not needed anymore.

If you want to play with this project, I would suggest using *IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition*.
This is because I set this up as an *IDEA* project, which you can try to use.

In the directory src you find a Main.java file, which you can call when compilation is finished.
You can give filenames as arguments on the command line when calling Main.
These files must contain valid *Mathematica* expressions.
They will be parsed and the program prints a sort of abstract syntax tree or full form of the
expressions or error messages if there are any problems.

You can use this ***Pratt and recursive descent parser*** parser as basis for other developments.

##![Development][dev-image] Development

### Code

Use *IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition*. Go to *Settings* and define an *External Tool* for
calling *JFlex*. Of course you have to install *JFlex* if it is not present on your system.
Use the following values:

- Program: /opt/idea/jre/jre/bin/java
- Parameters: -Xmx512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath /usr/share/java/JFlex.jar JFlex.Main -skel math.skeleton -d $FileDir$ $FileName$
- Working Directory: $FileDir$

If you want to crawl through the code, you should use the
[develop branch](https://github.com/cbarbat/Mathematica-Parser/tree/develop). It has the newest
version of the code.

### To do

Here is some food for thought:

- the two **Span** parselets are missing/commented out and must still be implemented

- **a_2** is parsed as **Pattern[a, Blank[2]]** - *Mathematica* parses it as
  **Times[2, Pattern[a, Blank[]]]**

- **a_b_** is parsed as **Pattern[a, Blank[Pattern[b, Blank[]]]]** - *Mathematica* parses it as
  **Times[Blank[],Pattern[a,Blank[b]]]**

- make a lot of tests to see where this parser is identical to *Mathematica* and where it differs
